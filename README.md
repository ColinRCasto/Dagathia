# Dagathia


## Common Ships
With around 90% of the planet covered in water, aquatic vessels serve the primary means of transportation for many. Over the course of history, many different methods of nautical travel have been explored and perfected.

### Steam Chargers 
Due to the efforts past of those with an affinity for metal work, Steam chargers are a common sight on the horizon. These large ships often sport metalic siding, and are often propelled by collosal steam engines located in the ships hull. Most Steam Chargers have a head engineer to manage the shipwrights board and serve as helmsman.

### Arcane Galleons
Not all ship builders enjoy tinkering with steam pipes and iron, Arcane Galleons serve as a valid choice for many who take to the seas. From the outside these would be easy to mistake for a traditional galleon until heading below deck. At the heart of most arcane galleons is a spellcaster who has dedicated their time and energy into helming these ships, using their magical talent to perform maintence and other meanial tasks on a ship by use of constructs, these 'Tin men' as they are often called are usually composed of driftwood stone, animated through the arcane arts in order make the maintenence of a ship far easier. Arcane Galleons almost always have a sea mage on board to serve as Shipwright and Helmsman

### Orcish Longship
Some wayfarers prefer not to fix what isn't broken, and opt to utilize the power of those on board to move the ship. The more honorable of these ships will feature a great many noble warriors below deck, rowing when the winds are uncooperative. Sadly much of the time, this is not the case, and you will be likely to find a legion of slaves below decks, populated by those unlucky enough to be captured during an orcish raid. Orcish longships are often repaired by the slaves on board and Helmed by an overseer.

## Ports
The world of Dagathia thrives on nautical trade, ports are fairly common throughout the region, some ports are known for specific trades and items, in ports players are able to do a number of things:
* Ship maintenence
* Buy and sell items
* Turn in bounties
* Find new wanted posters
* Learn skills and trades

Ports will also have an allegiance, wether it be to the Navy or The Pirate Lords, wich effects the general attitude of the denziens of the port towards the PC's. Generally this will not have a drastic affect, PC's with a high bounty/reknowned as pirate hunters can still generally trade and interact with a port, with the exception of the faction capitals, if/when the PC's have a strong connection to one side the other sides capital will essentially be off limits, it IS possible to visit the port but the PC's will not be able to safely use the pier, as well as have a high chance of being recognized and captured/killed.

## Nautical Encounters
Roll d100 a number of times based on distance travelled, rolling above the current threat level causes a roll on the dynamic threat table
* Encounter level is based on current events and the pressence along the route, the following table outlines some more common events that affect threat level

Effect | Dynamic Threat | Description
------ | ----------- | --------------
+5     |  ---        | A moderate storm has blown through the region, there are less people out on the water
+10    |  ---        | A devestating storm has wrecked the area, NO ONE is on the water
-10    | Monsters    | A tropical storm has agitated the waters, causing monsters to become agitated
-10    | Pirates     | There is rumor of a high amount of treasure in the region, Sending all manner of mid tolow level pirate crews out to the sea
-10    | Navy        | A recent naval training exercise or operation has the water swarming wiht naval ships
-15    | Travelers  | There was a recent trade summit or festival in a nearby port

### Bounty
While adventuring through Dagathia, PC's are bound to ruffle the feathers of either the Navy or the various pirate crews roaming the seas. The party is capabale of accruing two seperate bounties which will either be a black bounty issued by the navy for breaking the law, or a white bounty, issued by the pirate lords for defying their laws or capturing and killing important pirates. These bounties reflect the way various factions and NPC's view the party, affecting the sort of encounters they will see, these two bounties are not necesarily inversely proportionate, it is possible to accrue a high bounty with both factions, most often actions that offend the navy will gain favor with pirates and vice versa. The parties bounty will have a lasting impact on the encounter level when traveling the sea 

When travelling between islands roll d100, if the roll is above the encounter level roll on the following table to determine the encounter

d10 | Encounter | Hostility | Description
--- | --------- | --------- | -----------
--- | Pirates | with grey or white bounty pirates serve as the opposing force | Outlaws of the sea
--- | Navy | with black bounty the navy serves as the opposing force | The governments force to impose the, at times tyranical rule of law
1-2 | Opposing Force |-----  | Pirates or Navy, depending on the parties status in the world
3-4 | Monsters  | Hostile | Various flying or swimming creatures
5   | Travelers | Neutral | Any manner of merchants, bounty hunters, and adventurers
6 | Neutral/Allied force | Neutral|Whichever faction is not the opposing force|
7-10 | Dynamic Encounter |-----| Whichever encounter is more likely based on current events


## Ship Mechanics 
Players must regularly spend money at a port to maintain the ship and buy food
* If a player owned ship has a first mate, The first mate will give the party warnings and advice about when they need too, if they neglect this for too long the ship will slowly fall into disrepair
* Most Ships house a home crystal, a large crystal infused with teleportation magic, allowing anyone attuned to the crystal to cast the spell 'Homebound' teleporting them to the crystal.

1st level characters may take profieciency with a tool of their choice in addition to any proficiencies they would already gain from their class. The world of Dagathia is fundamentally built on the trade of goods and services, it would be almost impossible to find someone who has no sort of professional training.
