# The Ship 
Players must regularly spend money at a port to maintain the ship and feed the crew
* The first mate will give them warnings and advice about when they need too, if they neglect too the ship will slowly fall into disrepair
* There will be a rare events table that can cause crew members to sustain injury or get sick
* Crew mates will generally be pretty non-descript outside of the first mate
* The Ship houses some sort of crystal, the PCs can cast a ritual spell that the first mate will teach them:
[] The ritual can be cast by an individual, teleporting them and any items on them as well as up to one willing or incapacited individual to the crystal on the ship
[] The ritual can also be cast by multiple PC's in this case they must form a circle to cast, up to 4 individuals and a great amount of material that is in the circle they form will be teleported
