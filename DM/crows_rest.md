# Crows Rest
Crows Rest is a mid sized island in the Center Sea, the island is home to one of the tallest mountains in the center sea, resulting in most of the island being a harsh tundra. As far as civilization there is a small outpost village on the coast of the island, called 'The Foot' and an ancient stronghold atop the mountain, known as Ravens Peak. Long ago it is believed that Crows Rest was the seat of power for a long dead Human king.

## The Foot
'The Foot' is a pretty typical village, it has a general store, a blacksmith, a tinkerer, a shipyard, a Tavern, and scattered residences. The NPC's of The Foot are pretty close knit, Social Skill Checks to get information will use this table:

Interaction | DC | Result
:---------: | :---: | :----:
Pers/Int/Bribe | 20(100g) | Tells of rumours that he has heard Jellyman Rogers is holing up at Ravens peak, tells the PC's to talk to Griff, as well as offers up some cryptic detail about Rogers
Pers/Int/Bribe | 15(75G) | Rogers is most likely on the island, try talking to Griff
Pers/Int/Bribe | 10(50G) | Talk to Griff

_Whatever Location they first visit, the PC's will notice a bearded pirate (Shanks), clad in dark grey cloak and leather will be there, seemingly minding his own business, a DC 20 Insight or Perception Check will reveal that he is listening in on their conversation_

### The Inn (The Talon)
a cozy idyllic Tavern, considering the surounding area's frigid climate, furs of beasts line the walls and a fire roars in the hearth. Kal(Halfling) and Essie(Elf) Brinnytook run the Talon, both retired trappers that settled down together, spending their life savings to build the Talon:

#### Kal: Boisterous, Funloving, and Kindhearted.
#### Essie: Stoic but warm

### The General Store(Expeditions LTD)

## Talking to Griff
Griff is pretty forthcoming: his son Glarus was killed by Jellyman, on an Intimidate or Persuasion check of DC 23 he tells the PC's that jelly man seemed to Swallow his son whole.

## Shanks
When the players set out for Ravens Peak 'Shanks' will insist he come along, telling a story about how his wife was killed by Rogers, DC 28 Insight reveals this as a lie.

 if he does not, at any given time a DC 30 Perception check will let whover meets it notice that he is following them.

If the players DO allow him to come with him, there are several important checks to be made, if he takes more than 35 damage in a combat he will feign' death, only rising when healed or when he 'Succeeds' appropriate Death saving throws. Whenever interacting with a Downed Shanks, roll a Perception check for the player, if they beat a DC 25 check, they will notice he is playing dead.

Upon inspecting his gear or bedroll a DC 20 investigation will reveal correspondance from Bheldus Glitterfist, implying he is under his employ.

Natural 20 will reveal a heavy Iron charm, INT Check 17 or higher and the PC(Aside from Kevdak) vaguely recognizes the charm, Nat 20 and they know it's true origin.

While Keeping watch a nat 20 will alert a PC that Shanks is going through the party's things.
